# CLIAppTestingFramework
A small collection of classes for conviently testing a CLI app 

# Getting started:
For now you can either integrate the repo into your own project or just download the .jar
from the jar directory and add that to your project. 

**IMPORTANT: Use the edu.kit.informatik.Terminal provided with this project/the jar.**
This is both convenient, so you don't have to integrate the Terminal class anymore, and it 
ensures smooth operation by this package. 

# Usage:
As this readme is work in progress, please check the examples directory for the usage of the package. 
The examples are very explanatory.
