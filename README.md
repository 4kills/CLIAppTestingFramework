# CLIAppTestingFramework

This library comprises a small collection of classes for conviently black-box testing a Java CLI app.

Please note that this project was originally created as a support tool for the 
final examinations in the programming module at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), Germany; winter semester 2019/20. 
It was designed to help students conduct integration, as well as acceptance tests, in order to aid them in finding bugs in their software before submitting it for evaluation.  
Originally, this library was **not** designed as a <ins>general purpose</ins> testing framework. 

# Getting started:
For now you can either integrate the repo into your own project or just [download](https://github.com/4kills/CLIAppTestingFramework/releases) the library as .jar
from the releases section.  

**IMPORTANT (especially for students at KIT): Use the edu.kit.informatik.Terminal provided with <ins>this</ins> project for your terminal I/O.**
This is both convenient, so you don't have to integrate the Terminal class anymore, and it 
ensures <ins>smooth operation</ins> by this package.
